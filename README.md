# Implementation of Akyüz and Reinhard's Nosie Reduction Technique

This program reduces noise from LDR image stack and prepares them for HDR creation process.

### How to Run

1. Download and unzip the repo to your computer.
2. Change current directory in MATLAB to unzipped folder.
3. Add sub folders to search path
  * addpath('otherMethods')
4. Run **Akyuz_GUI.m** for GUI, run **denoise_main.m** for regular command line interaction.
